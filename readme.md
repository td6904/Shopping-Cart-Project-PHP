## About

A small shopping cart project created on the side thanks to a tutorial I followed on youtube. No longer have the link. Practicing working with classes, getters and setters, construct methods to simply create a new instance of a class and add it to a shopping card. Only to be used in the terminal.

Made during the time I was studying PHP at the Wild Code School Lille, France from September 2022 to December 2022.
